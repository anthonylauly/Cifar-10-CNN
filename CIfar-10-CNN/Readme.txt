This folder is specific to store a notebook that is created to guide a beginner who wants to know about tensorflow and deep learning. In this notebook, I will show you how to build a simple convolutional neural network that classify based on 10 objects. The dataset that I use is Cifar-10. 

Please open convnet.ipynb to see my work on it. The rest of the files are just images that I include in the work. Feel free to leave a feedback and open an issues if you found it. I look forward to your feedback. Thank you.
